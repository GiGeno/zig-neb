# zig-neb

This repository is for playing around with coding.

Will be used as a playground for different coding problems.

Over the years I created my own programming style, which is very specific.
I call it KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid
          ASAP - As SIMPLE As Possible.
Hopefully others could learn something too... maybe more things...

Regards,  ZiG.
